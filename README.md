## Overview
For this assignment, the requirements were to create a memory game using React. The assignment required breaking up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

### Specifications
1. Created a React application using [Create React App].

2. The application will render 12 different Pop Art-themed images to the screen. Each image is set-up to listen for click events.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score increments when clicking an image for the first time. 

5. The user's score will reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. The user will get a message that says, "POW! BAM!"

6. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.

7. The application is deployed to Github Pages. (https://jebaquera.github.io/Clicky-Game/).
